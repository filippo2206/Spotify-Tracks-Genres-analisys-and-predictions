# Spotify Tracks Genres analisys and predictions

Music genre classification is a task for various music platforms and it plays a crucial role in many domains,
such as music recommendation systems and personalized user experiences. The objective of this report is to
study this task from a statistical point of view using a dataset of music taken from Spotify. We will explore
the features of our data and investigate different techniques to classify five major music genres.
We will first provide an overview of our dataset, with the description and pre-processing of the data. Then
we will proceed with exploratory data analysis and the building of the models to predict the genre class
with different approaches. Finally we will evaluate the performance of our models and make a comparison
between them. We will use evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.
